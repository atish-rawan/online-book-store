                <p>Dear reader,

If you have a heart, you will fall in love. And chances are, someone will end up breaking your heart. I wrote this book after someone broke mine. What do you do when the only person you’ve ever loved with your whole heart decides to leave your life? You keep trying to run away from the hurt, but to no avail.

This book is a product of all the running I did from heartbreak. I feel everything too deeply, and when my heart broke, I collected all the broken pieces, and they fuelled my art. This book is everything I wrote after someone I loved left me. There’ s too much heartbreak in these pages, but also too much hope and, more than anything, a promise that life can’ t always hurt you.

I hope healing finds its way to you soon.

Love, Rithvik</p>

                <p>Reading books is a kind of enjoyment. Reading books is a good habit. We bring you a different kinds of books. You can carry this book where ever you want.
				It is easy to carry. It can be an ideal gift to yourself and to your loved ones. Care instruction keep away from fire.
				Falling in love is probably the best thing that can happen to a young writer; it gives a certain spontaneity and intensity to his writing. Stories such as ‘"The Night Train at Deoli’, ‘"Eyes Have It’ and ‘Time Stops at Shamli’, were written when I was in my early twenties, and have stood the test of time quite well.
				Fifty years after they were written they still turn up in anthologies aimed at both the young and the old.
In my thirties I came to live in the hills, and my love stories were now greatly influenced by the world of nature. Thus, ‘Binya Passes By’ and ‘On Fairy Hill’ have a magical, other-worldly feeling about them.

                <p>Born on the same day and at the same time, Druvan and Anvesha know they are soulmates in every sense of the word. Their parents, however, refuse to accept their 'togetherness' at first and try to tear them apart. Druvan and Anvesha try their best to explain why that cannot happen.

In the same timeline, the world has made huge progress in science and some of the first experiments to combine the body and the soul have begun. This is an opportunity for them to prove their love and tell the world that it is love that can make the impossible, possible.

Druvan and Anvesha participate in the experiment as if their life depends on it, because it does. The only thing that remains to be seen is, will the dream of a man to control love and life come true? And when the time comes, can one stay true to their soulmate?</p>

                <p>he newest, highly anticipated novel from beloved #1 New York Times bestselling author, Colleen Hoover. Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most. Lily hasn?t always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She?s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up?she graduated from college, moved to Boston and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily?s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He?s also sensitive, brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn?t hurt.
				Lily can not get him out of her head. But Ryle?s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ?no dating? rule, she can not help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan?her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector.
				When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all-too-human characters, it ends with us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

            <div class="description">
                <p> “It Ends With Us” is about someone who has the support and resources to break out of the cyclical nature of violence. “It Starts With Us” instead focuses on recovery and starting a new life of healthy love.
				It’s a story about feeling loved for the first time and giving the love you believe others deserve from you. This book explains that not all parental love is unconditional and not all romantic love will end. I feel certain that readers will find parallels between the novel and their own life, particularly the messiness that comes with love and loving. 
				“It Starts With Us” explores the  reality of relationships: Falling in love is easy, but loving is hard work. And in some way, all relationships are flawed — we simply must choose which imperfections we are willing to accept. As we grow older, we all redefine relationships, perhaps reflecting your parents’ love or an act of caring that you received when you were twelve. Some love arrives all at once, like typical parental love, and some love is felt in an instance.
				Overall, “It Starts With Us” is a beautiful read to complete the story started in “It Ends With Us.” The novel gently resolves some of the trauma at fault in the first novel and demonstrates to readers the possibility of happiness in fearful new beginnings. While lacking the emotional depth that made its predecessor so powerful, “It Starts With Us” successfully continues Lily’s story by telling the story of second chance love.
