            <h1>The Art of Being Alone: Loneliness Was My Cage, Solitude Is My Home </h1>

            <div class="description">
                <p>Taylor Swift said once, “The scary news is, you are on your own now. But the cool news is, you are on your own now” The fear of loneliness has been injected into our minds since we were kids. We have learned that the kid who eats, & sits alone, and has no friends is pathetic. 
				In every book/movie, the kid with no friends is always featured as a weak character who needs to be saved. No one wants to be seen as a ‘weirdo’ hence, our dread of being alone. We don’t want people to think of us as unwanted or not fitting in with the cool kids. We don’t want people to think that no one chose us. 
				So what do we do? We start becoming like an ideal version of whom everyone loves. And in the race to achieve people’s acceptance and love, you lose yourself. But enough is enough. The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about transforming loneliness into solitude. And the second section is about using your solitude to turn it into your growth period.
				If you are ready to transform your perception around loneliness and achieve your goals using your ‘alone time’ then welcome to ‘The Art of Being Alone.’

            <div class="description" >
                <p>From meeting with an old friend to losing a loved one, we all had something that made us reassess our whole existence.
				And while looking through a different perspective, aren't all those capable of being molded into a poem? The small love-note to those simple gestures, a few 'simple' things that have always refused to leave our hearts, weren't 'simple' at all.
				'String' is a song of the heart - its innocence, vulnerabilities, and healing. It compels you to shed your heavy and surrender to the author's words. 
				It's scary and satisfying to read poetry so deeply truthful and still wins over our hearts.

'Strings' is such a collection of moments shaped into a tale of poetry, prose and musings.
 Perhaps, you may find yourself between those pages. And that isn't coincidental.

                <p>“The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.”Vishesh is a dreamer, who is driven by his passion for writing and words. 
				But like most Indian middle class families, his parents are impatient to see him settled in a government job. Despite all obstacles, making no complaints, he continues to follow the hard path, holding up the promise he had made to himself, trying to fulfil his father's wishes and failing over and over.
				Almost everyone – his parents, friends and the love of his life – leaves his side in the middle of his journey. To worsen things, he is diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, the seriousness of which nobody could decipher before it was too late.
				Will a dreamer be sacrificed for social standing? Will a heart be crushed to uphold a hollow image?Left alone and misunderstood by everyone he knew, this is Vishesh's intense story of repeatedly falling down and trying to get up on his own, to prove that everyone who dares to follow their heart is not a commoner; he is 'The One From the Stars'.

                <p>No one has ever recorded the voice of Radha – one of the most powerful characters in all of chronicled history. As one half of the indivisible entity ‘Radhakrishnan’ she resonates through millions of lives every day.
				And yet, her songs remain unsung; her stories stay untold. Until now. This book, entitled an eponymous ‘Radha’; is a collection of 101 poems written in the voice of Radha. This book is Radha speaking to her beloved Krishna in poetry, across the ages, in an endless conversation that ebbs and flows and heaves and rests like the rhythm of a vast ocean. 
				Sometimes she is a young girl, sometimes she is an old woman, sometimes she is petulant in her love for her Krishna, sometimes she is unflinching in her courage in letting go of her beloved Krishna. This book is an imagined conversation between 2 of the most evocative characters of all time. Her Krishna is as present in the writing as Radha is, although he never speaks a word. 
				This is not a love story. This is the love story.

                <p>Dear reader,

If you have a heart, you will fall in love. And chances are, someone will end up breaking your heart. I wrote this book after someone broke mine. What do you do when the only person you’ve ever loved with your whole heart decides to leave your life? You keep trying to run away from the hurt, but to no avail.

This book is a product of all the running I did from heartbreak. I feel everything too deeply, and when my heart broke, I collected all the broken pieces, and they fuelled my art. This book is everything I wrote after someone I loved left me. There’ s too much heartbreak in these pages, but also too much hope and, more than anything, a promise that life can’ t always hurt you.

I hope healing finds its way to you soon.

Love, Rithvik</p>

				It is easy to carry. It can be an ideal gift to yourself and to your loved ones. Care instruction keep away from fire.
				Falling in love is probably the best thing that can happen to a young writer; it gives a certain spontaneity and intensity to his writing. Stories such as ‘"The Night Train at Deoli’, ‘"Eyes Have It’ and ‘Time Stops at Shamli’, were written when I was in my early twenties, and have stood the test of time quite well.
				Fifty years after they were written they still turn up in anthologies aimed at both the young and the old.
In my thirties I came to live in the hills, and my love stories were now greatly influenced by the world of nature. Thus, ‘Binya Passes By’ and ‘On Fairy Hill’ have a magical, other-worldly feeling about them.

            <div class="description">
                <p>This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it—for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.
				But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. 
				For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.

From the quiet joy of discovering the reach of Indian cinema and the origins of Indian vegetables to the shallowness of judging others based on appearances, these are everyday struggles and victories, large and small.

</h1>
            <div class="price"> ₹329.00

</div>
            <div class="description">
                <p> “It Ends With Us” is about someone who has the support and resources to break out of the cyclical nature of violence. “It Starts With Us” instead focuses on recovery and starting a new life of healthy love.
				It’s a story about feeling loved for the first time and giving the love you believe others deserve from you. This book explains that not all parental love is unconditional and not all romantic love will end. I feel certain that readers will find parallels between the novel and their own life, particularly the messiness that comes with love and loving. 
				“It Starts With Us” explores the  reality of relationships: Falling in love is easy, but loving is hard work. And in some way, all relationships are flawed — we simply must choose which imperfections we are willing to accept. As we grow older, we all redefine relationships, perhaps reflecting your parents’ love or an act of caring that you received when you were twelve. Some love arrives all at once, like typical parental love, and some love is felt in an instance.
				Overall, “It Starts With Us” is a beautiful read to complete the story started in “It Ends With Us.” The novel gently resolves some of the trauma at fault in the first novel and demonstrates to readers the possibility of happiness in fearful new beginnings. While lacking the emotional depth that made its predecessor so powerful, “It Starts With Us” successfully continues Lily’s story by telling the story of second chance love.

                <p>Vaidehi, an 80s bride, takes us through a tyrannical face of patriarchy, that is her life, and how she is able to live, love and find happiness despite her often unbearable circumstances. As she becomes a mother to twins - a boy and a girl - her spirit to ensure fails, as she sees the possibility of history repeating itself with her daughter's life.
				As her journey of feminism starts, she often fails in the face of society, making her daughter question her, in an ironical turn of events.

Maya is a millennial and revels in a sense of freedom that modern marriages commonly offer - until she is faced with a more passive-aggressive face of patriarchy and she's met with a demeaning treatment. As the silence of endurance that she has inherited from her mother and her exposure to feminism clash within her, her mind wanders outside of her marriage.

As Maya and Vaidehi's lives intersect, questions and confrontations explode and die out in the generational chasm that create everlasting rifts and regrets, which women live with.

                <p> Osho continues to inspire millions of people worldwide in their search to define a new approach to individual spirituality that is self-directed and responds to the everyday challenges of contemporary life. 
				His unique perspective encompasses both the timeless wisdom of the East and the highest potential of Western science and technology and he was named by the Sunday Times of London as one of the "1000 Makers of the 20th Century". 
				The American novelist Tom Robbins has called him "the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ".
This book is sheer brilliance. First understand Krishna and then dissect and analyse his character to perfection and depth. This is what Oshi has done. Osho is probably one of the new age personalities that has digested indian ideologies and reproduced them to greater intellectual contributions. By reading this book I am sure personality enrichment is also possible. 
This is a must read, even if you choose to skip other Osho books!!!!

                <p> Kevin has written down a beautiful novel, a retelling of the avatar of Lord Vishnu, Kalki, in a not so “mythological” manner. He has immense strength, which has been proven time and again by events like defeating enemies twice his size, faster healing of wounds and very sharp fighting skills. He doesn’t have a decent explanation about the skills he possesses until he meets Kripa aka Kripacharya—a guru who had been a part of the biggest battle against evil—the Mahayudh.
