                <p>he newest, highly anticipated novel from beloved #1 New York Times bestselling author, Colleen Hoover. Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most. Lily hasn?t always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She?s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up?she graduated from college, moved to Boston and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily?s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He?s also sensitive, brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn?t hurt.
				Lily can not get him out of her head. But Ryle?s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his ?no dating? rule, she can not help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan?her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector.
				When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all-too-human characters, it ends with us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.

            <h1>It Starts With Us – 1 January 2022</h1>
			<h2>by Kunex (Author, Editor, Foreword, Illustrator)</h2>
</h1>
            <div class="price"> ₹329.00

</div>
            <div class="description">
                <p> “It Ends With Us” is about someone who has the support and resources to break out of the cyclical nature of violence. “It Starts With Us” instead focuses on recovery and starting a new life of healthy love.
				It’s a story about feeling loved for the first time and giving the love you believe others deserve from you. This book explains that not all parental love is unconditional and not all romantic love will end. I feel certain that readers will find parallels between the novel and their own life, particularly the messiness that comes with love and loving. 
				“It Starts With Us” explores the  reality of relationships: Falling in love is easy, but loving is hard work. And in some way, all relationships are flawed — we simply must choose which imperfections we are willing to accept. As we grow older, we all redefine relationships, perhaps reflecting your parents’ love or an act of caring that you received when you were twelve. Some love arrives all at once, like typical parental love, and some love is felt in an instance.
				Overall, “It Starts With Us” is a beautiful read to complete the story started in “It Ends With Us.” The novel gently resolves some of the trauma at fault in the first novel and demonstrates to readers the possibility of happiness in fearful new beginnings. While lacking the emotional depth that made its predecessor so powerful, “It Starts With Us” successfully continues Lily’s story by telling the story of second chance love.
