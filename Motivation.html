            <h1>The Art of Being Alone: Loneliness Was My Cage, Solitude Is My Home </h1>

            <div class="description">
                <p>Taylor Swift said once, “The scary news is, you are on your own now. But the cool news is, you are on your own now” The fear of loneliness has been injected into our minds since we were kids. We have learned that the kid who eats, & sits alone, and has no friends is pathetic. 
				In every book/movie, the kid with no friends is always featured as a weak character who needs to be saved. No one wants to be seen as a ‘weirdo’ hence, our dread of being alone. We don’t want people to think of us as unwanted or not fitting in with the cool kids. We don’t want people to think that no one chose us. 
				So what do we do? We start becoming like an ideal version of whom everyone loves. And in the race to achieve people’s acceptance and love, you lose yourself. But enough is enough. The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about transforming loneliness into solitude. And the second section is about using your solitude to turn it into your growth period.
				If you are ready to transform your perception around loneliness and achieve your goals using your ‘alone time’ then welcome to ‘The Art of Being Alone.’

            <h1>Strings
</h1>
			<h2>by Reema Sherin (Author)</h2>
            <div class="price">₹589.00

</div>
            <div class="description" >
                <p>From meeting with an old friend to losing a loved one, we all had something that made us reassess our whole existence.
				And while looking through a different perspective, aren't all those capable of being molded into a poem? The small love-note to those simple gestures, a few 'simple' things that have always refused to leave our hearts, weren't 'simple' at all.
				'String' is a song of the heart - its innocence, vulnerabilities, and healing. It compels you to shed your heavy and surrender to the author's words. 
				It's scary and satisfying to read poetry so deeply truthful and still wins over our hearts.

'Strings' is such a collection of moments shaped into a tale of poetry, prose and musings.
 Perhaps, you may find yourself between those pages. And that isn't coincidental.

                <p>THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER

We all have an ikigai.
It's the Japanese word for ‘a reason to live’ or ‘a reason to jump out of bed in the morning’.
It’s the place where your needs, desires, ambitions, and satisfaction meet. A place of balance. Small wonder that finding your ikigai is closely linked to living longer.
Finding your ikigai is easier than you might think. 
This book will help you work out what your own ikigai really is, and equip you to change your life.
You have a purpose in this world: your skills, your interests, your desires and your history have made you the perfect candidate for something. 
All you have to do is find it.
Do that, and you can make every single day of your life joyful and meaningful.
‘I read it and it’s bewitched me ever since. I’m spellbound.’
Chris Evans
'Ikigai gently unlocks simple secrets we can all use to live long, meaningful, happy lives. Science-based studies weave beautifully into honest, straight-talking conversation you won’t be able to put down. Warm, patient, and kind, this book pulls you gently along your own journey rather than pushing you from behind.' Neil Pasricha, bestselling author of The Happiness Equation</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>“The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.”Vishesh is a dreamer, who is driven by his passion for writing and words. 
				But like most Indian middle class families, his parents are impatient to see him settled in a government job. Despite all obstacles, making no complaints, he continues to follow the hard path, holding up the promise he had made to himself, trying to fulfil his father's wishes and failing over and over.
				Almost everyone – his parents, friends and the love of his life – leaves his side in the middle of his journey. To worsen things, he is diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, the seriousness of which nobody could decipher before it was too late.
				Will a dreamer be sacrificed for social standing? Will a heart be crushed to uphold a hollow image?Left alone and misunderstood by everyone he knew, this is Vishesh's intense story of repeatedly falling down and trying to get up on his own, to prove that everyone who dares to follow their heart is not a commoner; he is 'The One From the Stars'.

</h2>

            <div class="price"> ₹262.00

            <div class="description">
                <p>This is a book about self-sabotage. Why we do it, when we do it, and how to stop doing it—for good. Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.
				But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential. 
				For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.

Sudha Murty-through the exceptional work of the Infosys Foundation as well as through her own youth, family life and travels-encounters many such stories...

				She talks candidly about the meaningful impact of her work in the devadasi community, her trials and tribulations as the only female student in her engineering college and the unexpected and inspiring consequences of her father's kindness.
